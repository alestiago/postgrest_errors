# 🧱 PostGREST errors brick

# Usage 🧑‍💻

1.  Install a valid [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) in your local environment. Compatible Dart SDK versions with `package:hooks` can be found within the [pubspec](hooks/pubspec.yaml). If you have Flutter installed, you likely have a valid Dart SDK version already installed.

2.  Install [Mason](https://github.com/felangel/mason/tree/master/packages/mason_cli#installation) in your local environment:

```sh
# 🎯 Activate from https://pub.dev
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

3.  Get hooks' dependencies:

```sh
# 🪝 Get hooks' dependencies (from bricks/postgrest_errors/hooks)
dart pub get
```

4. Get mason dependencies:

```sh
# 🧱 Get all mason dependencies (from project root)
mason get
```

5. Generate the source code for `package:postgrest_errors`:

```sh
mason make postgrest_errors --data-path="../../data/errors.json" -o packages/postgrest_errors
```

💡 **Note**: The generation uses the raw data from [errors.json](../../../data/errors.json), this is generated by the [scraper](../../postgrest_errors_scraper/).
